The integration of these technologies transforms wildlife conservation, enhancing understanding and enabling effective action for the protection of our planet's biodiversity.
			  </p>
        <h4>01. Endangered animal detection system.</h4>
		<p>Endangered species face the constant threat of extinction, with poaching being a major contributor to their decline. To combat this, technology is increasingly employed to safeguard these vulnerable animals, particularly through the use of cameras and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Camera traps, equipped with infrared (IR) technology, have emerged as a valuable tool for wildlife monitoring. They capture images and videos of animals in their natural habitats, aiding in understanding behaviors, movement patterns, and even detecting illegal activities like poaching.
      Automating animal detection through image processing is crucial in conservation efforts, as manual inspection of camera trap images can be time-consuming and error-prone. Machine Learning (ML) and AI technologies are harnessed to automate this process. ML involves creating algorithms that learn from data to make predictions or decisions, while AI mimics human intelligence to perform tasks that typically require human involvement. Together, they enable faster and more accurate animal detection.
      AI-based animal detection systems are a powerful tool in the protection of endangered species against poaching. These systems combine cameras with machine learning algorithms to detect animals in real-time. When an animal is identified, the system triggers an alarm to alert park rangers, facilitating a rapid response. Additionally, these systems can track animal movements, helping rangers anticipate potential poaching activities.
      Several studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of AI-based animal detection systems. For instance, in India, an AI-based system achieved a 95% accuracy rate in detecting and tracking tigers in a national park, aiding in the prevention of poaching. The "Instant Wild" project in Kenya utilizes cameras and AI to monitor and protect endangered animals by detecting different species and even the presence of humans, providing invaluable support to park rangers.
      However, implementing AI-based animal detection systems comes with challenges. High costs associated with cameras, software, and personnel can be a barrier. Additionally, remote areas may lack reliable power sources and internet connectivity, hampering system operation. Ethical concerns surrounding privacy and potential disruption of natural animal behaviors also need to be addressed. Despite these challenges, AI-driven solutions have become a promising means to protect endangered wildlife from the threat of poaching.
</p>
          <h4>02. Weapon detection system.</h4>
		  <p>Poaching, the illegal hunting and capturing of wildlife for various purposes, poses a severe threat to biodiversity and ecosystems worldwide. It is driven by the lucrative trade in rare animal products, leading to the extinction of approximately 30,000 species annually. Factors like climate change, deforestation, pollution, and overexploitation further contribute to the decline of species, with over 40,000 species categorized as threatened on the IUCN Red List. Biodiversity is facing a significant risk, with experts warning of a looming sixth mass extinction event.
        The lives of wildlife rangers are also in jeopardy due to the outnumbering of poachers and the potential danger of encountering traps meant for animals. Reports indicate that nearly two rangers lose their lives each week in poaching incidents.
        Poachers often use deadly methods such as snares, poisoned arrows, jaw bombs, and firearms. The illegal wildlife trade and the arms trade are intertwined, amplifying the challenges of combating poaching. Laws and regulations, like Sri Lanka's Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance (FFPO), are in place to curb the illegal trade of wildlife, but the pandemic, inflation, and job losses have exacerbated the issue.
        To address these challenges, an AI-driven anti-poaching system is proposed, focusing on the Yala National Park in Sri Lanka due to its high density of endangered species. Deep learning methods, particularly the YOLO-V5 one-stage object detection algorithm, will be employed to detect poachers by identifying their weapons. This approach offers faster detection and greater efficiency compared to traditional two-stage detection methods. Raspberry Pi, a low-cost single-board computer, will serve as the platform for the system, coupled with LoRa technology for data transfer in remote forest areas with limited internet connectivity. This innovative system aims to monitor endangered animals and predict and prevent poaching threats, providing a critical tool for wildlife conservation and protection.

      <h4>03. Gunshot detection and localization system.  </h4>
      <p>
        Gunshot Detection Systems (GDS) offer several advantages over traditional anti-poaching methods. One key advantage is their real-time detection and response capability. GDS can serve as an early warning system, enabling swift responses by rangers and law enforcement agencies to poaching incidents, reducing the chances of poachers escaping and ultimately lowering the overall number of poaching incidents.
GDS's ability to cover vast and challenging terrains, including dense forests and savannas, is another significant advantage. Many wildlife reserves and parks are extensive, making effective monitoring a considerable challenge. GDS can be strategically placed in poaching hotspots or hard-to-patrol areas, providing an additional layer of protection for wildlife populations.
Additionally, GDS operates without the need for direct human intervention, reducing the risk to rangers and personnel. Poachers are often armed and dangerous, posing a considerable threat to those confronting them. GDS can swiftly detect gunshots and alert authorities, allowing them to respond appropriately. This minimizes the risk to personnel and helps prevent potentially dangerous confrontations with poachers.
In the literature review, several research papers are highlighted. In 2019, a study focused on implementing a gunshot detection algorithm for an anti-poaching project in Costa Rica. The project used solar-powered microphones and wireless transmission to track illegal poaching, emphasizing acoustics research and code development for real-time detection. The results demonstrated the reliability and accuracy of the algorithm, with future considerations for localization research.
Another study in 2019 explored the concept of an "Animal-Borne Anti-Poaching System" to address the significant threat of wildlife poaching, especially for large-bodied species like elephants. This innovative approach fused GPS tracking collars with acoustic gunshot detection systems to create animal-borne sensors. These sensors could provide real-time alerts to rangers regarding gunshots near elephant groups, promising great potential for anti-poaching efforts.
In 2021, a research paper delved into "Low-Cost Gunshot Detection using Deep Learning on the Raspberry Pi." This paper examined the increasing use of acoustic gunshot detection systems in high-gun violence communities, raising questions about their effectiveness and reliability in various scenarios. It also explored the trade-off between gunshot detection and source localization, as well as the potential challenges of false positive events. The study provided insights into the hardware and algorithmic aspects of GDS, using the ShotSpotter system as an illustrative example, with relevance to various gunshot detection technologies.

        <h4>04.Forest fire detection system.</h4>
        <p> 
					Forest fires present a significant global threat to the environment and wildlife, resulting in the destruction of millions of acres of forestland and habitats annually. Efficient detection and monitoring systems are crucial for preventing and managing forest fires. Over the years, various technologies have been developed, including satellite-based remote sensing, thermal imaging cameras, and visible cameras.
Satellite-based remote sensing is a valuable tool for detecting and monitoring forest fires, particularly in remote and inaccessible areas. However, its drawback lies in the delay in acquiring and processing data, which can impede prompt responses.
Thermal imaging cameras are effective in detecting temperature changes caused by forest fires and providing real-time information on the location and intensity of the fire. Nevertheless, their high cost and limited coverage area make them less practical for large-scale monitoring.
Visible cameras have become an appealing option for detecting and monitoring forest fires due to their wide availability and cost-effectiveness. Recent advancements in computer vision and machine learning have made it possible to develop intelligent camera-based systems for this purpose.
A study conducted by Li et al. (2020) proposed a system that utilizes a network of strategically placed visible cameras in the forest. These cameras capture real-time images, which are then processed using a machine learning algorithm to accurately detect and classify forest fires.
Similarly, Wang et al. (2019) introduced a forest fire detection system that employs visible cameras and deep learning. This system utilizes a deep neural network to detect and classify forest fires in real time, demonstrating its effectiveness in forest environments.
Sensors can also play a vital role in detecting forest fires. Nongpiur et al. (2018) proposed a system that utilizes wireless sensors placed throughout the forest to identify changes in temperature that may indicate the presence of fires. The data collected by these sensors is then processed using machine learning techniques to accurately detect and categorize forest fires.
Furthermore, Khelil et al. (2016) introduced a forest fire detection system based on a wireless sensor network. This system employs a network of wireless sensors to detect temperature fluctuations and wirelessly transmit the data to a central processing unit. The collected data is then analyzed using machine learning algorithms to effectively identify and classify forest fires.

</p>
          <h4>02. Weapon detection system.</h4>
		  <p>Two prominent automated applications, PAWS and Capture, have been developed to combat poaching using AI, primarily in Queen Elizabeth National Park in Uganda, Africa. PAWS relies on historical SMART data to predict efficient ranger patrol routes, while Capture employs a temporal behavioral model to detect poachers' behavior and optimize ranger patrolling. These applications are known for their predictive capabilities based on past incidents and behavior but lack real-time weapon detection. In Sri Lanka, no active automated system for detecting weapons and poachers existed as of July 2023. Still, a review of the Uwa Region Incident Log for 2023, including Yala National Park, revealed over 26 cases of illegal poaching and weapon possession, underscoring the dangers faced by park rangers. Our research sets itself apart by focusing on real-time weapon detection through cameras, providing date, time, and location information to alert park rangers when potential threats are detected. Poaching's impact on endangered species is significant, leading to biodiversity loss. While poaching statistics are primarily maintained in a limited number of countries, the issue affects not only wildlife but also poses dangers to the lives of wildlife rangers who often confront traps and poachers. Low ranger-to-park size ratios, difficult terrain, and challenges related to accuracy in existing systems further compound the poaching problem. The data on elephant deaths in Sri Lanka reveals a distressing trend, with a significant number of deaths attributed to gunshots and other poaching-related causes, emphasizing the urgent need for effective anti-poaching measures and the protection of endangered species.
